# Configuration

Restory has almost no configuration, only some conventions. However, if there is no necessary configuration, it is difficult for users to customize. When you are using `Restory dev` , a `.reactstory` folder is created in the current folder with a `config.js` file:

```js
// .reactstory/config.js
module.exports = {
  readmeName: 'Introduction', //string
  title: 'ReStory', //string
  github: false, //boolean
  repo: 'https://github.com/Foveluy/ReStory', //string
  footer: 'ReStory Â©2018 Created by ZhengFang' //string
}
```

Let us explain them one by one.

# header

## readmeName

When you set `readmeName`, you can change the name of the `README button` on the header.

## title

The name of your project, this title will be displayed on the far left of the header.

## github and repo

If you are writing a github documentation, you can set `github` and `repo`, `github` represents the button that displays github in header (default is true) , and repo fills in the project's github address.

```js{4-5}
// .reactstory/config.js

module.exports = {
  github: true,
  repo: 'https://github.com/Foveluy/ReStory',
}
```

# others
