## Global Installation

If you just want to play around with VuePress, you can install it globally:

```bash
# install Restory globally
(sudo) npm config set unsafe-perm true && npm i -g restory


# create a markdown file
echo '# Hello ReStory' > README.md


# start writing
restory dev


# build
restory build
```

<Warning>
you might noticed that 「npm config set unsafe-perm」 command must be entered, it is because the ReStory is dependent on a pinyin library to process Chinese characters.
</Warning>
