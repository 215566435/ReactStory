# Introduction

ReactStory is a minimalistic static site generator.It was created to support the documentation needs of React's projects.

Each page generated by ReactStory has its own pre-rendered static HTML, providing great loading performance and is SEO-friendly. Once the page is loaded, however, ReactStory takes over the static content and turns it into a full Single-Page Application (SPA). Additional pages are fetched on demand as the user navigates around the site.
