# Restory

Restory (AKA ReactStory) is an extremely lightweight static document generator that supports writing React components directly in Markdown.

## How does it work

Restory is a single-page application driven by React, React Router, Webpack, and Node.js. Restory will complete the rendering of the page during the building phase, providing a superb browsing experience and very good search engine optimization (SEO) for the production environment.

## Inspiration
